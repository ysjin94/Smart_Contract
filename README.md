## Purpose of Contract:

Music streamming code smart contract. It is like kind of a vending machine for music. Owner only can add Code for the streaming. The buyers can buy the code via the smart contract. If the buyer use the code on music website or application, they can lisen to music for a day without any interrupt such as Ad, infinite skip songs, and more. Only the seller can add the codes, and buyers can know that there are not no coupon if the code is sold out. Of course, it is Non-refundeable, because if the buyer get the code, seller cannot know the buyer use or not.
